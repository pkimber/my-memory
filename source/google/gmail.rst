`2 hidden ways to get more from your Gmail address`_

- Append a plus ("``+``") sign and any combination of words or numbers
  after your email address.

  For example, if your name was ``hikingfan@gmail.com``, you could send mail
  to ``hikingfan+friends@gmail.com`` or ``hikingfan+mailinglists@gmail.com``.

- Insert one or several dots ("``.``") anywhere in your email address.  Gmail
  doesn't recognize periods as characters in addresses - we just ignore them.

  For example, you could tell people your address was ``hikingfan@gmail.com``,
  ``hiking.fan@gmail.com`` or ``hi.kin.g.fan@gmail.com``.
