`Python for Newbies - Interacting with the User`_

``input`` works just like ``raw_input``, except Python interprets the
variables as whatever is typed in.  If that didn't make much sense, think of it
this way: If you have a straight-up number, it's stored as a number.  If you
have some values in [] brackets, it's stored as a list.  You can even put
something in quotes to have a string.

Consider using the ``raw_input()`` function for general input from users.
