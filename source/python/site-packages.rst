How does it work?
=================

Wanted to add ``libgmail`` to ``site-packages``.

Copied source to:

::

  C:\Tools\Python24\Lib\site-packages\libgmail

But ``import libgmail`` did not work.  To solve created a file called:

::

  libgmail.pth

in:

::

  C:\Tools\Python24\Lib\site-packages

The contents of this file are simply the folder name:

::

  libgmail

For more information see ``site.py`` in:

::

  C:\Tools\Python24\Lib
