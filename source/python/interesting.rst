`Python at Google`_

Google makes extensive use of Swig.  Greg indicated that Swig has improved
much in recent years.  All C++ projects in Google have swig generators
created during build time, so python programmers can take advantage of this
work.  Greg said that **neither Boost nor ctypes were as direct or clean as
using SWIG**.
