CeeFIT
******

Could not get CeeFIT compiled.  Does not seem to be much activity anywhere.
See :doc:`fitnesse-cpp`

Install
=======

Downloaded ``CeeFIT-1.1.1-src.zip``, installed to:

::

  /home/patrick/src/fit/

::

  cd /home/patrick/src/fit/imp/cpp/
  cp build.properties.example build.properties

Could not get the included version of ant to work...

::

  vim /home/patrick/src/fit/imp/cpp/ant

Changed:

::

  # ANT_HOME=./lib/apache-ant-1.6.5
  ANT_HOME=/usr

Is not working!!!  Perhaps look at Fitnesse
