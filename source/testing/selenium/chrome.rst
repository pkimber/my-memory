Chrome WebDriver for Selenium
*****************************

Change the code in from ``webdriver.Firefox()`` to ``webdriver.Chrome()``.

Download *ChromeDriver server for linux* from
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/

I downloaded:
http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.16/chromedriver_linux64.zip

Extract the contents of the archive (a single file called ``chromedriver``) to
a folder on your ``PATH``.  I copied ``chromedriver`` to ``~/bin/``
