- `Bulk Convert from MS Office Binary to OpenXML`_
- Docvert_ takes word processor files (typically ``.doc``) and converts them to
  *OpenDocument* and clean HTML.

Convert
=======

To convert Word to PDF, try http://www.doc2pdf.net/.  It works very nicely.
I also tried loading a document into Microsoft Live, but to print the document
you need Microsoft Word!

Remove all formatting
=====================

In Microsoft Word you can remove all formatting not associated with the current
style like this:

- For a single word place the cursor in that word and hit Ctrl-Spacebar
- For a paragraph place the cursor in that paragraph and hit Ctrl-Q (I am not
  sure this one works)!
