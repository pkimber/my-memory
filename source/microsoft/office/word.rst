From `Where are Microsoft Office for Mac My Templates`_

Where are Microsoft Office for Mac My Templates stored?

In the english version of Word and PowerPoint 2011, templates are stored inside
your home folder in::

  ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates

In other languages, the ``User Templates/My Templates`` part is localized (e.g.
Benutzervorlagen/Eigene Vorlagen/ in german).

The Library folder is hidden in Lion, but you can go there by holding down
*Opt*/*Alt* while clicking the *Go* menu in the Finder, then selecting
*Library*.

Convert
=======

To convert Word to PDF, try http://www.doc2pdf.net/.  It works very nicely.
I also tried loading a document into Microsoft Live, but to print the document
you need Microsoft Word!

Open a Word 2007 document in an earlier version of Word
=======================================================

`Open a Word 2007 document in an earlier version of Word`_

Download and install the `Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack`_ for Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats.

Remove all formatting
=====================

In Microsoft Word you can remove all formatting not associated with the current
style like this:

- For a single word place the cursor in that word and hit Ctrl-Spacebar
- For a paragraph place the cursor in that paragraph and hit Ctrl-Q (I am not
  sure this one works)!

Scanner
=======

`Word 2007 scanner option, MS took the scanner option away in 07`_

Click the *Insert* tab, *Clip Art*, *Organize Clips* (lower right), *File*,
*Add Clips to Organizer*, *From Scanner or Camera*...
