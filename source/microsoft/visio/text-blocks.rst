Text Blocks
***********

Each shape in Visio has an associated text area associated with it.  This text
area or *text block* will always move with the shape.

To move the text block for a shape:

- Click on the arrow which is just to the right of the text tool (The *text
  tool* is the letter *A* which looks like the bold button)
- Select the *Text Block Tool*.  You can then move the text block -or- click on
  the *pointer tool* to move the whole shape.

Get in the habit of switching back to the *text tool* when you have finished
moving *text blocks*.
