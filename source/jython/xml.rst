XML
***

Note
====

XML, or more specifically ElementTree (:doc:`../python/xml`), does not seem to
be very well supported under jython.

I have been using the Java, built in XML parsing modules...

Here is some sample code which shouldn't need any extra jar files added to the
``classpath``:

- XmlHelper.py_
- XmlHelperTest.py_


.. _XmlHelper.py: ../../misc/howto/jython/XmlHelper.py
.. _XmlHelperTest.py: ../../misc/howto/jython/XmlHelperTest.py
