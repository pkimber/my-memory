Description
===========

Character Entities References are the way you put special letters, numbers and
symbols on the web page.

A character entity reference consists of an ampersand (``&``), followed by a
hash sign (``#``), the number of the character entity, and finishing with a
semi-colon (``;``).  Alternately, for some characters you can put ampersand,
the name of the character (but no ``#`` sign), followed by a semi-colon.

Example
=======

To produce the copyright symbol:

::

  &#169;

or (because the copyright symbol has a name):

::

  &copy;
