User cannot change status
=========================

- I think Redmine is happier when a normal user isn't an administrator.
- To solve this problem, select the administrator, *Workflow* option.  Select
  the *Role* of the user e.g. *Developer*, and the relevant *Tracker*, then
  click the *Edit* button.
- Tick all relevant boxes.  This would normally be *Check all* and empty the
  top-left to bottom-right diagonal.
