`Getting Started With WikiText`_

Advantages:
===========

- Linking: in a wiki, inside the same wiki, or any web-page - really fast
  without much effort.
- Versioning.  wiki source can easily be version controlled.  Most wikis
  provide simple and quick methods to display page differences.
- Searching.
- Sharing.  Everyone in the team can correct/add articles to the wiki, with
  a very low overhead.

*This makes writing documentation really fast, and that is user friendly to me
as a developer, since I do not need to delay other work for the sake of being
able to communicate how and what i have done, i.e. setup of an IDE, or building
a software project.  As i said, when it comes to documenting installations etc.
I can do it simultaneously, and we all know that if it's not done immediately,
it won't be done for a long time, if even at all*.

Usage
=====

- wikis are tools for information management and collaboration, not for
  creating shiny Docs/Presentations for customers.
