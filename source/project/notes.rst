Article - Building the Right Project Team
=========================================

Article From *JDJ*, January 2007.

Assume you are the project manager for a newly selected technical
implementation for a specific line of business that you're familiar with.
You've been chosen for this effort because of the confidence that both the
business and technology departments have in you to get the job done. Your past
record speaks for itself and you have an opportunity to select people currently
in your company as well as augment the team with new hires and consultants.
Whether your project requires a medium or large-scale project team you should
plan your team accordingly.

Always plan in five-person team increments.

Business/Technical Lead
-----------------------

This person should be someone who understands the business requirements very
well and hopefully was one of the main authors of the *Business Requirements
Document*.  This individual should be technically very strong, but doesn't
necessarily know all the technologies that have to be deployed to implement the
system.

Technical Architect
-------------------

This person is responsible for designing the technical framework in which the
entire system will be built.  He should be intimately familiar with all the
technologies required to deliver the system and be mindful of all governance
requirements in your organization.

This is the lead person who will insure the technical success of the project.

Data Analyst
------------

This person should be knowledgeable about all of the data elements required for
system implementation as well as where the data currently resides in the
organization and how to gain access to it.

This person will coordinate all DBA requirements and work with the governance
group in the organization as well as lead all logical and physical database
design efforts.

Technical Programmer
--------------------

This person will be responsible for coding parts of the system based on the
direction of the Project Manager.  For example, this person may be the
front-end technical programmer.

Technical Programmer
--------------------

This person will be responsible for coding parts of the system based on the
direction of the Project Manager.  For example, this person may be the
application server programmer.

of all the unknowns*.
