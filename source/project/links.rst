- `Difference Between Internal and External Release`_
  *Think of the in-pipe in this example as engineering and the out-pipe as the
  business.  Engineering can post releases at its own pace.  The business can
  selectively choose from the posted releases.  In this paradigm, marketing is
  not obligated to promote a release upon its completion.  Marketing might do
  so in three months; it might choose to promote the current release with
  another release due at a later time; it might choose to make a release
  available on a limited basis; or it might choose never to promote a
  release*.
