Grails - Database
*****************

Configuration
=============

Grails database settings can be found in:

::

  grails-app\conf\DataSource.groovy

Configuring the data source is a simple matter of changing the values for the
desired database and driver and placing the driver ``jar`` file in the ``lib``
directory.
