Decrypt
*******

Verity is managing to decrypt a document which Lucene is unable to.

The following blog entry:

http://www.searchmorph.com/wp/2005/05/09/use-pdfbox-to-get-text-out-of-locked-pdf-files/

Downloaded and copied to:

::

  ~\articles\pdfbox\Using PDFBox to get text out of locked PDF files.html

This change suggested in this document has already been done in the CVS
repository, revision 1.64 of ``org.pdfbox.util.PDFTextStripper``.

Building the version in CVS will successfully decrypt my reference document.
