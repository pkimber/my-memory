Eclipse - Spring Configuration
------------------------------

Spring was not picking up changes to a configuration file.  We had several
instances of the application running within Eclipse.  We terminated all
instances and the changes were recognised.

Make sure you terminate all existing instances of a Spring application before
launching a new one.
