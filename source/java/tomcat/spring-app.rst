Spring Application
******************

Working through:
http://www.springframework.org/docs/MVC-step-by-step/Spring-MVC-step-by-step-Part-1.html

To deploy had to give permissions/create folder/subfolders for:

::

  /opt/tomcat5/work/Catalina/localhost/springapp/

The ant file command for build works fine.  But ant deploy, install and
deploywar do not seem to produce a working installation.

But I can deploy the war file and get a working system.
