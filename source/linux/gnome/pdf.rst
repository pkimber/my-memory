.. tip:: I used ``pdfarranger`` (``pdfshuffler`` doesn't seem to be working
         any more): https://github.com/pdfarranger/pdfarranger

pdfshuffler_ is very nice for moving and deleting pages.  It is in the Ubuntu
Software Centre::

  sudo apt-get install pdfshuffler

.. note:: Looks like development has stopped (although it works perfectly well
          for me: https://github.com/fuesika/pdfshuffler-ng).
