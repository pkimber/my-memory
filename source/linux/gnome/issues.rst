Window List
===========

No open programs show on panel:

Add the *Window List* item to the panel.  In my case, the icons were still
there, they were just squashed to one side.

Zoom
====

On several occasions, I have accidentally zoomed the desktop using *Super*,
*Middle Mouse Button*, *Drag*!!!

To restore the desktop to a non-zoomed state, try *Super*, and rolling the
*Mouse Wheel* until the desktop is OK again.

Note: I am sure there is a better way to do this, but I haven't found it yet!
