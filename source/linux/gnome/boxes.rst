Gnome Boxes
***********

.. highlight:: bash

.. note:: I managed to install Ubuntu 14.04 in Boxes with no problem, but I
          couldn't get a network connection from my laptop to the virtual
          machine.  Lots of searching on Google and I was no further forward.

In the virtual machine::

  apt install spice-vdagent
