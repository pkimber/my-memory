ref `How to get python 2.4 or 2.5 for Ubuntu 10.4`_:

- Browse to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/python2.4.
- Click on *Show Builds*.
- Change the state to *Successfully built* and click on *Filter*.
- Choose a build matching the architecture of your workstation.
- Download the required files.  I downloaded:

  ::

    python2.4-minimal_2.4.6-1ubuntu3_i386.deb
    python2.4_2.4.6-1ubuntu3_i386.deb
    python2.4-dev_2.4.6-1ubuntu3_i386.deb

- Install...

...or, this is easier if you don't want the development libraries:

Install python 2.4 and 2.5 by adding ``ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes`` to your
system's Software Sources:
https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes
