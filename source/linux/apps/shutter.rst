Shutter
*******

Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program.

I was trying to take screenshots of a whole web page.  Shutter says it cannot
take screenshots of a web page until ``gnome-web-photo`` is installed.

I installed ``gnome-web-photo`` and Shutter still can't take screenshots of web
pages, but I can use ``gnome-web-photo`` to do that now::
