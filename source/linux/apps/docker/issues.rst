Issues
******

When I start docker I don't have access to the internet:

::

  docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
  WARNING: Docker detected local DNS server on resolv.conf. Using default external servers: [8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4]

I did some Google searching and tried some things, but I don't really
understand what is going on.

Check out :doc:`getting-started` for a solution...

.. note::

  The solution works at the generator offices, but it doesn't work here at
  home.  So I am guessing this might be a firewall issue on my router?
