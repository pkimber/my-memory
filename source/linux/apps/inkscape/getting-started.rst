Rounded Corners
---------------

- `Inkscape Tutorial - Shapes`_

  To round the corners on a rectangle, grab the *rounding handles* at the top
  right of the shape.

Shadow
------

- The first thing is to copy the object you want to have the drop shadow for.
- Next you want to change the color of the copy to black and set the blur to
  10 or so.
- Now you send the object to the background
- And last you align the object a little bit offset from the original...
