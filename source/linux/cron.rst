cron
****

.. warning:: If a cron script in ``/etc/cron.d`` has a ``.`` in the file name,
             then it will not run!

Configuration (System)
======================

::

  /etc/crontab

email
=====

To email the output of your cron job to a specific user, add the following
at the top of your cron script::

  MAILTO=patrick@mycompany.com

To stop emails::

  MAILTO=

...or pipe the output of your command to a file (see *Logging* below)...

Logging
=======

To write output to a log file, add the following after your command::

  >> /home/my-user-name/logs/update_index.log 2>&1

Note: This re-directs ``stdout`` AND ``stderr`` which isn't much good if you
are doing a SQL dump to ``stdout``.  In this case, try something like this::

  mysqldump --host=localhost --user=patrick --password=mypassword redmine > $DUMP_FILE 2>> $LOG_FILE

System
======

System cron tasks are configured from the ``/etc/crontab`` file.  The
``/etc/crontab`` file is set-up to run commands hourly, daily, monthly and
weekly::

  /etc/crontab

To set-up a task to run at these times, just add your shell script to the
relevant folder::

  /etc/cron.daily
  /etc/cron.hourly
  /etc/cron.monthly
  /etc/cron.weekly

.. note:: Check your shell script file name does **NOT** have an extension.
          For details, see `run-parts doesn't run script with sh extension`_

.. note:: To run a command at a different time, setup your file in the
          ``/etc/cron.d`` folder.  Note: The files in this folder are in
          ``crontab`` format with the user inserted before the command (see
          *Sample*, *System* below):

User
====

.. tip:: It is probably less confusing to use the global cron system for jobs
         on a server.  It Will be easier to work out which processes are being
         run...

To view your own ``crontab`` file::

  crontab -l

To edit your own ``crontab`` file::

  crontab -e

To edit the ``crontab`` file of another user::

  crontab -e -u username

A nice looking cron script layout (from the link below)::

  MAILTO=me@mail.com
  # minute (0-59),
  # |       hour (0-23),
  # |       |       day of the month (1-31),
