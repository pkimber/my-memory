Debian
======

::

  E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: syntax enable

Debian Linux appears to install a cut down version of vim.  To install the full
version:

::

  apt-get install vim ctags vim-doc vim-scripts

...or... install the python enabled version, :doc:`install/install`.

Mapping
=======

If key mapping doesn't work, then check your function keys are enabled!!
