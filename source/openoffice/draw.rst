Flowcharts
==========

For long, thin flow-charts, just use a custom paper size which is the same
width as A4, but as long as you want it to be.

Header and Footer
=================

To create headers and footers, and elements to the master page:

*View*, *Master*

Shadow
======

To add shadow to an object:

Right click on the object and select *Area*, *Shadow* or
Select the object and choose *Format*, *Area*, *Shadow*.

Word wrap text in shape
=======================

`Re: oooDraw: word wrap text & resize shape to fit text`_

If the option to *Word wrap text in shape* is not available...

*You have probably not created a shape but a plain rectangle or polygon.  I do
not think these options are available for them.  Try creating your polygons
from the "basic shapes" or the "flowchart" buttons in the drawing toolbar and
you will be allowed to do word wrap etc....*
