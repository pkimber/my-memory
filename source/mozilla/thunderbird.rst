By default, Thunderbird doesn't seem to display sub-folders.  To subscribe to
these folders, right click on the user account and select *Subscribe...*

Plain Text
==========

`Plain text e-mail`_

To send all e-mails in plain text

- Click *Tools* - *Account Settings*.
- Under the first account on the left, click *Composition & Addressing*.
- Uncheck *Compose messages in HTML format* (at the top).
- Repeat the above 2 steps for each account displayed on the left, then click
  *OK*.
- Click *Tools* - *Options* and then, on the left, click *Composition*.
- Change *Forward messages:* to *Inline* (at the top). (This setting causes
  some forwarded messages to appear at the bottom of the e-mail instead of in
  a MIME attachment).
- Uncheck *For messages that contain 8-bit characters...* (in the middle)

Once Thunderbird is configured for plain text, holding the *Shift* key when you
click *Write*, *Reply*, or *Reply to All* buttons (but not *Forward*) will send
one e-mail in HTML format.
