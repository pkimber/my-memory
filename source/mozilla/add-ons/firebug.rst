Logging
=======

To write to the Firebug console:

- Add log statements to your JavaScript code:

  ::

    console.log("%d ways to skin a cat.", 101);

  Note: This is the same as calling ``window.console.log``.

- You can view the console output in the *Console* tab.

  Note: Click on *Persist* to keep the log output between page changes.
