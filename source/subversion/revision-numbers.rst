Revision Numbers
****************

Merge
=====

When merging (for example from revision 2194 to the HEAD), the changes in 2194
are NOT merged into the target source.  The changes from 2195 to the HEAD will
be merged.

Release
=======

Discussion with Richard, Helen, Simon and Paul

There is not really a standard for the company.

Will be something like

::

  6.0.0

Or for internal releases:

::

  6.0.0.<Build Number>

So my first tag could be:

::

  0.0.1

and the second:

::

  0.0.2

Is not really defined and does not matter until I am ready to release:

::

  1.0.0
